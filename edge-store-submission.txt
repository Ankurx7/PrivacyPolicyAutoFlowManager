ApplyFlow Manager is a privacy-focused browser extension that helps automate job application forms. While the extension does access personal information, it is designed with privacy as a core principle:

1. All personal data (including profiles, contact information, work history, and education details) is stored LOCALLY on your device using the browser's Storage API.

2. NO data is transmitted to external servers, third parties, or even to the extension developers.

3. Users have complete control over their data and can edit or delete it at any time through the extension's interface.

4. The extension requires specific permissions (storage, activeTab, scripting, tabs, contextMenus, notifications) solely to provide form auto-filling functionality.
